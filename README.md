## What even is **moe**?
```
Moe refers to feelings of affection, adoration, devotion, and excitement felt towards characters that appear in manga,
anime, video games, and other media (usually Japanese). Characters that elicit feelings of moe are called "moe characters."
The word has also evolved to be used regarding all kinds of topics. Included in the meaning of the word is the idea that
"deep feelings felt towards a particular subject" is used in cases where a simple "like" is not enough to express the
feeling. The common feature in all feelings of moe is that the subject of such feelings is something that one cannot
possibly have a real relationship with, like a fictional character, a pop idol, or an inorganic substance. It can be
considered a kind of "pseudo-romance", but it is not always seen to be the same as "romance".
